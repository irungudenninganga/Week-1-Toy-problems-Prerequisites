# Week-1-Toy-problems-Prerequisites

Toy problem prerequisities is a project based on caculating an specific input and outputing a grade in general.

## Project Description

The top problem prerequisities is a problem solver since :

1 it's solves problem regarding grading marks between 0 and 100 where by you enter the marks (
    > **NB** The process to enter the marks will be provided soon.
)

2 It also solves problem regarding the speed in *km/s* where by the speed limit is 70 km/s, when the speed
  is enterd more than 70, it will automatically caculate the speed and when the speed limit is exceded for 
  every 5+ increase it will give the driver a point, when the points exced 12 points the drivers license 
  will be suspended.(
    > **NB** The process to enter the speed  will be provided soon.
)

#### How the project works 

1 For the Student grade generator you need to open it with a [text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) where you will find the first folder 
  node-modules which is a package used to provide the user with input like feature on the terminal after runing node and the name of the file 
  'node Student-Grade-Generator.js' and press enter, the terminal will display an input channel named 'Enter score:' and you will be needed to add 
  the marks you want to be graded and press Enter to run and output the Grade in general e.g 
  
  > ![App Screenshot](![Alt text](./images/enter-display-on-terminal.png))
  * Enter score in the terminal 

  > ![App Screenshot](![Alt text](./images/graded-score.png))
  * Grade will be printed on the terminal

2 For the speed detector follow the same process of opening the 'Speed-Detector.js' and runing node on the terminal 
  * This is for speed below the speed limit 70km/s

  > ![App Screenshot](![Alt text](./images/run-node-on-terminal.png))
  * Press Enter to run

  > ![App Screenshot](![Alt text](./images/input-speed.png))
  * Enter the speed of car
  * Press Enter to run on the terminal

  > ![App Screenshot](![Alt text](./images/output-1-on-terminal.png))
  * if speed is less than the speed limit which is 70km/s it will output ok and the points will be 0


  * This is for speed above 70    

  > ![App Screenshot](![Alt text](./images/output-2-on-terminal.png))

  * When the driver exced 12 points the license get suspended
